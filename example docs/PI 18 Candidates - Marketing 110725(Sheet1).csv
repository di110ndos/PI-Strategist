,Blue Green Deployment,"is a release strategy that uses two identical environments—one live (Blue) and one idle (Green). New updates are deployed to the idle environment, where they’re validated without impacting users. Once testing is complete, traffic is seamlessly switched to the updated environment, minimizing downtime and enabling quick rollback if needed.",XL,2,,,,,

Epic 11323,WinWatcher re-write to pull from API for game data and discontinue file drops for game data,"WinWatcher was built pre 2020 and has a lot of bad/unused code and does not utilize cache.

This work also includes revisiting the timing of the draw games cache to be more inline when files drop vs every 1-2 minutes, as well as getting the new cache enhancements to prod that done late last year. This project would increase performance and reduce db utilization, which would in turn reduce the need to scale up the db as frequently as we do now.",XL,8,,,,,
,Security Modernization,"Improve secure coding standards, reducing both security and coding technical debt while enhancing developer efficiency and confidence.
By embedding secure-by-design principles, standardized code review practices, and automated vulnerability detection into our development lifecycle, we not only protect our products and clients — we also empower developers with cleaner, more maintainable code.
Improving security at the coding level helps developers by reducing rework, simplifying future integrations, and providing clearer guardrails for safe innovation. This approach strengthens client trust, accelerates delivery timelines, and establishes a foundation that allows us to innovate securely and sustainably.",XXL/ XL,10,,,,,
,Modernizing Load Testing Software,"Currently the load testing is a manual process that requires heavy configurations that relies on a java framework called JMeter. While we still may convert the new load testing framework to JMeter or another Azure Load Testing framework called Locust, we would like to move to a more modern approach to use a JavaScript framework, something like K6 or Artillery. We would be integrating this directly into the CI/CD pipeline to run on each deployment, ensuring site performance is being closely tracked with each release. With a new JS framework, this would allow QA to own load testing updates during their test case creation.

k6 is lightweight, CLI-driven, and emphasizes developer-friendly workflows, making it comparable to JMeter for load and performance testing without the overhead of a full GUI.",M,11,,,,,
,Infrastructure Security Maintenance and Ops ,"Mature foundational security practices across our products and platforms — reducing technical security debt, strengthening client trust, and enabling future innovation.By standardizing secure design principles, embedding risk-informed controls, and addressing legacy vulnerabilities, we can build a resilient foundation that not only meets compliance expectations but also positions security as a business enabler. This transformation will allow us to deliver with confidence, accelerate new feature adoption, and open doors for innovation in a secure and scalable way.",L,12,,,,,
